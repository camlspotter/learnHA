    r"""Using multi-step backwards differentiation formula (BDF) to calculate the
    coefficient matrix. We have concatenated all the trajectories into a single list because this helped us discard fewer data than
    considering trajectories as a list of independent trajectories. This is because, for the first M points (M the
    step size of BDF), derivatives can not be computed using the backward BDF. In contrast, for the last M points,
    the derivatives can not be computed using the forward version of BDF. Thus, we discard each trajectory's first and
    last M points (2M points) if we consider independent trajectories. Therefore, considering a concatenation of all
    the trajectories as a single item list will allow us to avoid this discarding of 2M points from each trajectory.
    Moreover, the position of points becomes easy to track concerning a single concatenated list.
